# 💰 Secret Auction — Python Project

A confidential bidding system built in Python.
A simple, interactive command-line auction app that allows multiple participants to bid secretly. Each bidder enters their name and bid amount without revealing it to others. When all bids are in, the program announces the highest bidder and their winning amount.
Developed as part of my #90DaysOfCode challenge to improve understanding of loops, functions, data structures, and real-world logic building.


# 🎯 How It Works

The program displays a logo (from ascii.py).
Each participant enters:
🧑 Their name
💵 Their bid amount
The screen clears to keep the auction private.
Once all bids are placed, the program finds and displays the winner with the highest bid.


🧩 Project Structure

```bash

├── ascii.py              # Logo or banner in ASCII art
├── main.py               # Main auction logic
└── README.md             # Documentation

# 🧠 Concepts Practiced

Python functions and modular design
Loops (while and for)

Dictionaries for storing name–bid pairs
Conditional logic
String formatting using f-strings


💻 Sample Run

```bash
Welcome to the Secret Auction! 💰
What is your name?: Alice
What is your bid?: $250
Are there any other bidders? Type 'yes' or 'no': yes

What is your name?: Bob
What is your bid?: $300
Are there any other bidders? Type 'yes' or 'no': no

🎉 The winner is Bob with a bid of $300
```

# 🔮 Future Enhancements

- ✅Add a GUI using Tkinter or Flask
- ✅Store bids in a database
- ✅Use os.system('cls' or 'clear') for better screen clearing
- ✅Add input validation and error handling
- ✅Implement a timer-based bidding system
